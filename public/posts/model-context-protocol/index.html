While right now only Claude desktop and a couple of other apps support it, it&rsquo;s an elegant way to extend the capabilities of a LLM.
You can think of it like a plugin system, but it solves a lot of the problems that come with plugins such as security, performance, and compatibility.
Security in this case comes by having a small &lsquo;server&rsquo; that is separate from the main app, and that can be run in a sandbox (if needed). This server can be written in any language, and can even be run on a different machine than the main app (although right now, it isn&rsquo;t really supported.)">

You can think of it like a plugin system, but it solves a lot of the problems that come with plugins such as security, performance, and compatibility.
Security in this case comes by having a small ‘server’ that is separate from the main app, and that can be run in a sandbox (if needed). This server can be written in any language, and can even be run on a different machine than the main app (although right now, it isn’t really supported.)">

<p>While right now only Claude desktop and a couple of other apps support it, it&rsquo;s an elegant way to extend the capabilities of a LLM.</p>
<p>You can think of it like a plugin system, but it solves a lot of the problems that come with plugins such as security, performance, and compatibility.</p>
<p>Security in this case comes by having a small &lsquo;server&rsquo; that is separate from the main app, and that can be run in a sandbox (if needed). This server can be written in any language, and can even be run on a different machine than the main app (although right now, it isn&rsquo;t really supported.)</p>
<p>By having it as a separate process, it can be run in a different security context and you don&rsquo;t need to expose the main app to the internet directly or expose API keys, as the server can be the only thing that talks to the internet.</p>
<p>In addition, since the main app and the server talk a standardised protocol based around JSON-RPC, it&rsquo;s easy to write a server in any language, and it&rsquo;s easy to write a client in any language.</p>
