Published at [https://til.wwff.tech/](https://til.wwff.tech/)

This is a collection of things I've learned in my day-to-day life. It's a mix of programming, system administration, and other things I find interesting.

Reminder to self: I should write more often.

```bash

cd quickstart
git init

echo "theme = 'ananke'" >> hugo.toml
hugo server
```
